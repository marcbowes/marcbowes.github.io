title: Ruby 1.9.3.rc1 is out
---

Hooray! Ruby 1.9.3 RC1 is out. You can read the [announcement
here](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/388203). If
you hop on to the
[NEWS](http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_9_3_rc1/NEWS) page
you may find some interesting things. My favourite:

* net/http
  
  `Net::HTTPRequest#set_form`: Added to support both
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`.
  
* optparse

  support for bash/zsh completion.

* test/unit

  New arguments: `-j N`, `--jobs=N`: Allow run N testcases at once.
      
* yaml

  The default YAML engine is now Psych. You may downgrade to syck by
  setting `YAML::ENGINE.yamler = 'syck'`.
